## Soft Skills

### **Communication**

#### **Writing**
* **Definition**: Conveying information clearly and concisely in written form.
* **Why It Matters**: Clear documentation, incident reports, and design proposals prevent misunderstandings.
* **Example**:
  * Writing a postmortem that includes: incident summary, timeline, root cause, and action items.

#### **Oral**
* **Definition**: Verbal communication in meetings, stand-ups, and discussions.
* **Example**:
  * Explaining a complex architecture to a non-technical stakeholder without using jargon.

#### **Presentation**
* **Definition**: Structured verbal and visual communication to an audience.
* **Best Practices**:
  * Use visuals, diagrams, and flowcharts instead of heavy text.
  * Tailor depth of content based on audience (engineers vs. executives).
* **Example**:
  * Presenting a Kubernetes migration plan to leadership with benefits, risks, and cost.

### **The XY Problem**
* **Definition**: Asking about a specific solution (Y) instead of explaining the actual problem (X).
* **Example**:
  * Asking “How do I increase TCP backlog size?” instead of explaining “My app drops connections under high load.”
* **Why It’s Bad**:
  * Hides the real issue, leads to wrong fixes.
* **Tip**:
  * Always state the **actual problem** before describing attempted solutions.

### **Collaboration**
* **Definition**: Working effectively with others to achieve shared goals.
* **Example**:
  * Pair-programming to debug a production issue.
* **Best Practices**:
  * Actively listen.
  * Share credit.
  * Use async tools (Slack, email) for distributed teams.

---

### **Problem Solving**
* **Definition**: Breaking down complex issues into manageable steps and finding solutions.
* **Example**:
  * Using the “5 Whys” method to find the root cause of a system outage.
* **Tips**:
  * Avoid jumping to conclusions.
  * Test small hypotheses before implementing big changes.

### **Curiosity**
* **Definition**: Desire to explore, learn, and understand deeply.
* **Example**:
  * Investigating how DNS resolution works internally instead of just knowing the command `dig`.
* **Why It Matters**:
  * Leads to proactive improvements and innovation.

### **Navigating Ambiguity**
* **Definition**: Making decisions when requirements are incomplete or unclear.
* **Example**:
  * Designing a system with vague performance targets, and iterating after gathering real metrics.
* **Tips**:
  * Ask clarifying questions.
  * Document assumptions.
